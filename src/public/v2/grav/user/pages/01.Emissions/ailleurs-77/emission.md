presentation: "Taste a year’s worth of musical touring in just one Ouï-dire!\n\nThis is an invitation to take an unstable but very interesting and just fucking fun trip starting on French boats, hospitals and wheelchairs, healing and then going to the rainy forests in Wales full of trippy people in the bonfire woods, radically changing to the lovely dust storms at Nowhere, ice-cold keg beer in the middle of the desert, blinking led canes, passing thru costume and torture chambers in London, meat freezers in Dordrecht, red lighted Amsterdam radio shows, burning party dancefloors in Paris and very sunny naked friendly beaches in Barcelona as well as the rambla’s darkish alleys with really refreshing giant gin & tonics and of course, absinthe, without forgetting to eat all that magnificent pizza in Italy of course!\n\nBon appétit…"
